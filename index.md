## About Me
Hello! I am Micah Brody an aspiring cryptographer. Currently, I am a mathematics and computer science double major at Bradley University. My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science and conduct research in cryptography. Some of the subjects I am most interested in are certified deletion, anonymous credentials, ORAM, and privacy-preserving systems. I am still finding new interests all the time. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

## Projects

### Post-Quantum Mercurial Signature Scheme
This summer I did an REU at Clemson University where we studied mercurial signatures. These are digital signatures which carry a unique property of being able to convert the secret key, public key, and signature in specific ways to make them unrecognizable, but equivalent. This allows them to be easily constructed into delegatable and/or anonymous credentials. With the ever nearing threat of quantum computer, We modified the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar Signature Scheme (UOV) to create a mercurial signature that is quantum-secure. Thank you to everyone I got to work with: Dr. Ryann Cartor, Sheny Perez, Madison Mabe, and Antsa Rakotondrafara. (Our Paper is currently in submission).

## Other Interests

### Rock Climbing
I work at the Bradley University Rock Wall. If you are in Peoria, you should come by!

### Digital Privacy
I often encourage the use of privacy-friendly services. Many people ask me "is \_\_\_ a good service" or "what should I instead of \_\_\_?" [Here](privacy.md) is a page of my most common answers to these questions.
