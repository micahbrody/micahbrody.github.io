# Privacy Recommendations

If this looks like too much information for you, just look for this symbol: :heavy_check_mark: 

(Note: This doesn't mean it's what I use. It means it's the easiest for most people.)

I made this list to answer the questions "what should I use for x" and  "what do you use for y?" Here are all my answers. I use or have used almost everything on this list and vouch for them. However, I am one person.

Other great websites to help with this are:
