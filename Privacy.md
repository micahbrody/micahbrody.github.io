# Privacy Recommendations
I made this list to answer the questions "what should I use for x" and  "what do you use for y?" Here are all my answers. I use or have used almost everything on this list and vouch for them. However, I am one person. If you are looking for a category I do not have listed, more alternatives for ones I do, and/or a more thorough guide to privacy, I recommend privacyguides.org.
